I am a research meteorologist in the . My interests are in tropical meteorology (especially hurricanes), atmospheric predictability, and more broadly, the science behind weather prediction.

I received my PhD in Meteorology and Oceanography in 2014 from the University of Miami in Miami, Florida, USA. In 2016, traded the beach for the mountains and moved to Colordao to become an Advanced Study Program postdoc at NCAR. In 2018, I was hired as a Scientist I in MMM, and I was promoted to Scientist II in 2022.

One of my overarching research goals is to improve the prediction of extreme weather phenomena. I am versed in analyzing numerical simulations as well as observations. Recently, I've become hooked by global cloud-resolving models and their promise to predict the weather from local to planetary scales. Therefore, I am spending most of my time running and anlyzing global cloud-resolving simulations.
