I am a research meteorologist in the <a href="https://www.mmm.ucar.edu">Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Laboratory (MMM)</a> at the <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu">National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)</a>. My interests are in tropical meteorology (especially hurricanes), atmospheric predictability, and more broadly, the science behind weather prediction.

I received my PhD in Meteorology and Oceanography in 2014 from the University of Miami in Miami, Florida, USA. From 2016â€“2018, I was an Advanced Study Program postdoc at NCAR. In 2018, I started as a Scientist I in MMM, and I was promoted to Scientist II in 2022.

One of my overarching research goals is to advance numerical weather prediction, and especially the prediction of extreme weather phenomena. I have expertise in running and analyzing global cloud-resolving simulations.
