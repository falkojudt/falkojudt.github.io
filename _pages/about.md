I am a research meteorologist in the [Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Laboratory (MMM)](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu) at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)](https://ncar.ucar.edu). My interests are in tropical meteorology (especially hurricanes), atmospheric predictability, and more broadly, the science behind weather prediction.

I received my PhD in Meteorology and Oceanography in 2014 from the University of Miami in Miami, Florida, USA. In 2016, I traded the beach for the mountains and moved to Colorado to become an Advanced Study Program postdoc at NCAR. In 2018, I was hired as a Scientist I in MMM, with a promotion to Scientist II following in 2022.

One of my overarching research goals is to improve the prediction of extreme weather phenomena. I am versed in analyzing numerical simulations as well as observations. Recently, I've become hooked by global cloud-resolving models and their promise to predict the weather from local to planetary scales. On any given day you will probably find me running and anlyzing global cloud-resolving simulations.
